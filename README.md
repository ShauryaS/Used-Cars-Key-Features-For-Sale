## Overview
This project aimed to identify key factors influencing used car prices and build a predictive model for a used car dealership. The chosen models for evaluation were Normal Linear Regression and Ridge Linear Regression. After thorough analysis, the Normal Linear Regression model emerged as the preferred choice, achieving an accuracy of 69.2% and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 53,051,003.7.

## Business Success Criteria
The project successfully met the business criteria, providing a model that accurately predicts used car prices based on various features. The identified features, including year, model, engine cylinders, odometer, and manufacturer, align with customer preferences in the used car market.

## Model Selection
- **Selected Model:** Normal Linear Regression
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Accuracy: 69.2%
  - MSE: 53,051,003.7

## Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** The data cleaning process effectively preserved a substantial portion of the dataset for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored key features and their impact on used car prices.
3. **Model Building:** Developed Normal Linear Regression and Ridge Linear Regression models.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluated models based on accuracy and MSE, leading to the selection of the Normal Linear Regression model.

## Project Outcomes
- **Learnings:** Acquired knowledge in creating predictive models and determining feature importance.
- **Business Insights:** Identified crucial factors influencing customer preferences in used car purchases.

## Areas for Improvement
1. **Model Refinement:** Experiment with model parameters for enhanced accuracy.
2. **Hardware Upgrade:** Due to hardware limitations, explore options like better GPUs or cloud computing for testing more complex models.

## Conclusion
The project successfully addressed the business goals, providing the used car dealership with a reliable model for predicting prices. Future improvements include refining the model and exploring advanced computing resources for more sophisticated analyses.
